We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to the "Projects - Community" folder! This space is dedicated to showcasing the innovative work done by our community members. To ensure a smooth contribution process and maintain the quality of our repository, we've outlined the specific requirements and steps you need to follow.

## Contribution Requirements

Before you submit a request to add your project, please make sure it meets the following criteria:

1. **Project Quality:** Your project should be complete, well-documented, and offer value to others learning or working in AI and ML.
2. **Documentation:** Include a README.md file in your project folder with the following:
   - A brief description of the project
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage instructions
   - A list of contributors (if applicable)
   - References to any datasets, libraries, or frameworks used
3. **Code Standards:** Your code should be clearly commented and follow best practices for code structure and formatting.
4. **Licensing:** Ensure your project has a clear and appropriate open-source license.

## How to Make a Request

To request the addition of your project to the "Projects - Community" folder, please follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Project:** Make sure your project meets all the requirements listed above.
2. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the main repository to your own GitHub account.
3. **Add Your Project:** Place your project folder within the "Projects - Community" directory of your forked repository. Ensure your project folder name is descriptive and follows this naming convention: `ProjectName-YourGitHubUsername`.
4. **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Submit a PR to the main repository with a clear and concise title and description. In the description, explain the purpose of your project, how it contributes to the community, and any other relevant details.
5. **Review Process:** Once your PR is submitted, the repository maintainers will review your project. You may be asked to make revisions. The review process ensures that all projects in the community folder meet our standards and requirements.

## Review and Acceptance

The repository maintainers will review your submission based on the quality of the project, adherence to the contribution requirements, and overall fit with the community's goals. While we aim to accept as many quality projects as possible, submission does not guarantee acceptance. You will be notified of the decision through the GitHub PR discussion thread.
