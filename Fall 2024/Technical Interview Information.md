## Technical Interview Information
Here's the link to sign up for a slot if you haven't already: **https://www.signupgenius.com/go/805044EA9AB22A4F94-53255450-technical**

### General Overview
The technical interview will be about 5 min consisting of 3-4 questions from material covered in the Machine Learning Bootcamp this semester. The questions could be from any of the 4 section covered in the MLB: White box models, Neural Networks, Fine Tuning, or RAG. You won't be asked to code anything during the interview.

### Material to know
1. **White box models**
	*	Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVMs, and Random Forest (a collection of decision trees)
	*	Overfitting
	*	Overall process of splitting data into train and test, training the model, and evaluating it.
2. **Neural Networks**
	*	The different components of a Neural Network (neurons, bias, weights, activation function)
	*	How data flows through the network (neuron * weights + bias)
	*	How the network makes the final classification at the end
	*	How the network measures the error in its prediction and adjusts ( Cost functions like MSE, and Back-propagation. You don't need to understand Back-Progagation, just what its general purpose is)
3. **Fine Tuning**
	* What is fine-tuning, and what are some general use cases of fine tuning? 
	* Which layers are changed/adjusted in the process of fine-tuning?
	* Advantages and disadvantages of fine tuning
4. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**
	* What is the purpose of RAG?
	* What is an embedding? 
	* What is the process of RAG, starting from when the user asks a question to your application? (Question to embedding, find relevant information with cosine-similarity, and return the relevant information)

### Some more advice
This is just an activity that is meant to giv
e you experience in preparing for real world technical interviews in industry. If you did the projects and you have a decent understanding of most things, you'll be more than fine. Please don't stress about this technical interview and definitely don't sacrifice school work for it, it's only here to give you some practice for the real world and teach you a little about Artificial Intelligence!
