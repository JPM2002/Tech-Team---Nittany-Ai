# Decision Trees From Scratch

This document focuses on how to build a Random Forest model from scratch, but you can do any model you would like (if you're looking for something easy, do Linear Regression or Logistic Regression). Use Youtube and ChatGPT to help you out!

## Overview
Decision trees are the foundation of the most popular (and arguable the most effective) white box machine learning model. They are extremely important in AI, so understanding them will be very beneficial to any AI engineer. If you're curious, a collection of decision trees form different types of models, most notably XGBoost and Random Forest, two of the most important algorithms in AI.

As the project name implies, the goal here is to build a decision tree from scratch, which isn't as hard as you might think!

## Getting started
1. Get a good understanding of how decision trees work
2. Download a dataset to try it on (this is the iris dataset but you can do whatever): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris
3. Implement a decision tree on the dataset to make predictions!

Remember, use ChatGPT to help you when you get stuck! This isn't a school assignment so I don't care if you use AI, as long as you're getting a better understanding of what decision trees are!
